## Introduction

Hello, here is my personal website where I will be continously iterating on it. (Created Dec 2024!)


## Developer Notes

Planned Updates:

-Integrate Github REST API to display project repo's directly on the website. (projects, leetcode obsidian vault)
-Incorporate Three.js UI components
-Incorporate Google Spreadsheets as the CMS system
-Expand on CSE 100 projects, create a web app for the huffman encoding project

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
